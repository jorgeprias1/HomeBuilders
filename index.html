        <h3> 10% of people are Homeless</h3>
        <p> Did you know that 10% of the world or even more are currently homeless? We think that number is just too
          high! People who are homeless do not only have nowhere to live but they also suffer from stigma. Get bullied
          by others, and many time also need food to survive. Here at Homebuilders, we want to reduce that 10% into 0%!

        <h3>2000 Homes!</h3>
        <p> Our mission is to create home for the homeless As you may have notice, many people today do not have homes.
          And especially when it involves kids, this can be very devastating. For that reason, we started Homebuilders!
          And we pledge to build 2000 homes every year!.</p>
